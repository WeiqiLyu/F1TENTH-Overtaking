# f1tenth-overtaking
This a repository that contains ready-to-run autonomous racing packages for the [F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/) on ROS2 (>= Foxy). It can be directly be deployed on the physical car. We've also included launch and config files for the [simulation environment](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros), which uses slightly different topics for odometry.
